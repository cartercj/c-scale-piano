# Task #

With a functioning C-Scale piano, we have determined that adding more scales is not incredibly complex, and have thus elected to add songs with a "teachable" note register, simulated harmony, and simulated melody.

To generate songs on the DE2 board, we employed a pseudo-state machine, which used a counter to shift between the notes of a song.  Our first song choice was "Oh When The Saints Go Marching In," as it is a fairly simple song in the key of C. The first step was mapping the harmony of the song to the different notes generated by the **notegen** module. After completing this task, we began the process of generating a "teachable" note register for the song. Initially we only implemented one HEX display, _HEX1_ on the DE2 board which corresponded to the note of the song which was currently being played.  We chose to use the letter of the note rather than the letter on the keyboard to be more consistent to a standard piano. Based on the limitations of the keyboard, the notes we marked using 'A', 'b', 'C', 'd', 'E', 'F', '9' (corresponding to a 'g').

Both the "teachable" note register and the melody were mapped to switches _SW17_ and _SW16_ respectively.  We elected to use switches rather than keys so that the user would be able to choose which parts he/she wanted to implement alone or simultaneously.  The harmony of the song is outputted through only one speaker, so that the other may be mapped to the keyboard. This allows the user to practice the song both with or without the simulated melody. This separate mapping inspired us to write a version of the harmony for the song as well, which would be played through the speaker opposite the melody. This allows the user to both here a more complex version of the song, and also him/her to play along with the harmony after learning the song. In order to start at the beginning of the song, the user must press _KEY0_ which acts as a universal reset for the system.
