# Task #

Our first task in implementing a playable piano on the keyboard is determining which signals are generated by the **PS2\_Controller** module created by Jonathon Rose at the University of Toronto.


# Results #

After first analyzing the code for the **PS2\_Controller**, we were able to determine how communication worked between the keyboard and the Altera DE2 board.  We then mapped the various inputs and outputs of the module to the appropriate pins on the DE2 board.  This allowed us to create a list of the signals generated by the keys which we would be using in out piano, as follows:

> For natural notes (white keys)
    * Q - 8’b00010101
    * W - 8’b00011101
    * E - 8’b00100100
    * R - 8’b00101101
    * T - 8’b00101100
    * Y - 8’b00110101
    * U - 8’b00111100
    * I - 8’b01000011
    * O - 8’b01000100
> For sharps/flats (black keys)
    * 2 - 8'b00011110
    * 3 - 8'b00100110
    * 4 - 8'b00100101
    * 5 - 8'b00101110
    * 6 - 8'b00110110
    * 7 - 8'b00111101
    * 8 - 8'b00111110

After compiling this list, we set out to create a module which was able to differentiate which key was currently being pressed. This led to the creation of the **key\_reader** module, which converts the input from the **PS2\_controller** into manageable signals based on the notes position in a scale.
